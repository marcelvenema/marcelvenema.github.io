My apologies for not writing any blogposts lately. This does not mean I am relaxing at the beach. On the contrary, I am very busy with my one of my newest project, CROWD29.COM

<!--more-->

{{< image src="levin-i8IPxSMJWtA-unsplash.jpg" alt="CROWD29.COM" >}}

CROWD29.COM is a new revolutionary IT community with to learn, deploy, certify and enjoy everything about Microsoft, Citrix, VMWare and RES Software products and virtualization in general. Unfortunately I cannot reveal more but the community will go live during the E2Evc conference, 12-14 June in Berlin.

Stay tuned!
