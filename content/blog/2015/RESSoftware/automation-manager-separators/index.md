Last year I wrote about creating placeholders in RES Software Automation Manager for better readability of tasks, modules and projects.

Apparently RES Software also took notice of this tip and introduced a separator option in RESONE Automation 2015. Right-click on any of the task, modules, projects or runbook window and select ‘Add separator’.

You can enter a separator name and description. Placing a separator between the modules will make it better readable. Separators do not affect the order of execution. The name of a separator can contain a maximum of 255 characters. The description of a separator can contain a maximum of 4000 characters. The use of hyperlinks is supported.
