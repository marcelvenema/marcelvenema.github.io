Part 6 of 6: **Copy Reference Images to an MDT Deployment share** 
The last part of the Reference Image Factory series is to copy the created reference images to the MDT Deployment share.

The MDT Reference Image Factory mostly consists of two MDT deployment shares:


1. a deployment share to deploy the operating system to servers and workstations and 


2. A reference image share to periodically create .WIM files which will be used with the deployment share. 


The .WIM files must be copied from the Reference Image share to the MDT deployment share Operating Systems folder.
