**Goodbye DotNetNuke, Hello Wix.com!** 

After using DotNetNuke for more than a decade, I finally moved to a new website platform. It all started in back in 2003 or 2004 where I downloaded the IBuySpy application, written in ASP.NET. I was looking for a website platform and was very impressed. After Microsoft declared it as the first open source project and it was rebranded to DotNetNuke I started using it.

The platform was hosted on a virtual machine in my home lab. It survived a lot of crashes, rebuilds, upgrades and other disasters but with the upcoming end-of-support of Windows Server 2012 R2 it was time to move on.

And yes, although I can value traditions, proven track records and stable services, hosting it on my homelab was not an option anymore. I moved all my websites, 9 in total, to a specialized hosting company. I want to focus on content rather restoring databases at night.

In the upcoming weeks my daughter will move my old blogposts to the new platform. With the new platform I am also more excited to share more posts, so stay tuned!
