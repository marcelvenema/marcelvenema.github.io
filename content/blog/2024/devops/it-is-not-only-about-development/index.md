In a recent project, I was asked if I could deliver an infrastructure-as-code project within a tight deadline. I accepted this, noting that certain conditions must be in place for me to achieve this within the given timeframe. Unfortunately, the project failed...

Actually, the project was many years ago, but recent events made me think about this again. The project back then failed due lack of management decisiveness and absence of a project team. For me, the only condition to work on a project is to have a team. The most important part of the project is project management and the project team itself.<br/>

Sure, a developer is crucial for writing code and building the technical foundation of the product, but without a team a developer is nothing.
The roles within a project team go beyond coding, ensuring that all aspects of the project—from planning to testing—are covered effectively. Each role contributes specific expertise that together form a comprehensive approach to delivering a high-quality product.

A project manager plays a vital role in organizing and overseeing the entire project. They buy licenses, manage timelines, resources, and communication between stakeholders. Without a project manager, projects may suffer from lack of direction, resulting in missed deadlines, unclear objectives, and poor communication, which can derail the entire development process.

An architect is essential for designing the overall structure of the system. The architect is responsible for making high-level design decisions that affect the entire project, ensuring that the software system is scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligned with business goals. They create the blueprint for the system, defining how different components will interact, what technologies will be used, and how the system will meet both current and future requirements.

Another key role is that of a product owner, who is responsible for understanding customer needs and translating them into technical requirements. They prioritize features and ensure that the final product meets user expectations. Without a product owner, there may be a disconnect between what the developer builds and what the customer actually needs, leading to wasted resources and a product that falls short of its intended purpose.

Testers or quality assurance (QA) specialists play a critical role in ensuring the product functions as intended by identifying bugs and performance issues before the product reaches users. Without proper QA, a project might be released with critical bugs, causing customer dissatisfaction, increased support costs, and potential reputational damage.

DevOps or system administrators handle the infrastructure and deployment of the product, making sure it scales well and operates smoothly in different environments. In their absence, the project could face significant technical debt, deployment delays, or even system crashes, especially as the solution grows or traffic increases.

Ultimately, a single developer, no matter how skilled, cannot fulfill all these responsibilities effectively on their own. A successful project requires a collaborative team where each member brings specialized expertise to ensure all aspects—technical, managerial, and user-centric—are covered. Without these roles, projects can encounter serious setbacks, ranging from inefficient workflows to poor-quality products that fail to meet user expectations or business goals. Having a team in place not only spreads the workload but also ensures that the project remains on track and delivers a product that users love.


In short, you need a project team if you want to deliver a succesfull project. If you don't have these condition in place, the project will fail, guaranteed.
