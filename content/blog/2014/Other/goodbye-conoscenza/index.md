Due to legal reasons I was not able to blog it earlier, but I am happy to announce that I have quit my consultancy job at my previous employer and start my own independent IT consultancy firm.

I worked with pleasure the last three years with ConoScenza and would like to thank them for the confidence, opportunities and collaboration.

As of 1st May I am owner of an independent IT consultancy firm specialized in the field of Workspace Management, VDI/SBC and application virtualization. It is a big step for me but I am really looking forward to it. I will continue to blog and sharing knowledge and information to the community. 

If you are interested in hiring me, see my About Marcel page on my website for current and past certifications, projects, resume and contact information.

**Update**: Just started as lead engineer on a major Citrix XenApp project.
