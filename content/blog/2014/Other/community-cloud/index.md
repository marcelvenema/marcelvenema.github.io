In June 2012 I started the CommunityCloud to share knowledge between co-workers, friends and colleagues. The goal is to share and exchange information between each other.

It is a cloud-based peer-to-peer network and file storage which is replicated between each other. For the file storage I use a Synology NAS. Files between my co-workers are automatically synced so I can focus on my own RES Software and Citrix expertise and still have the latest Microsoft and VMWare information and files present.

Also with [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/), [SabNZB](http://sabnzbd.org/), [SickBeard](http://sickbeard.com/) and [SurveillanceStation](http://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/index) packages my wife is also happy so she can watch TV.

Currently, there is a FileCenter for files, DocumentCenter for documents and information and a TrainingCenter for training and study materials.

For co-workers, friends and collegueas, if you want to join the CommunityCloud, you are very welcome. Remember, it is not a freebee. If you join, you need to also invest a little time to keep your part of CommunityCloud up-to-date. Please drop me an e-mail for username and password and you can login here. (link not valid anymore)
