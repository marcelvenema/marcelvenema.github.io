I am a huge gadget freak. From the [HomeWizard](http://homewizard.nl/) home automation system to the [WMe wristband](http://www.phyode.com/products.html), I have it or at least tried it.

Today I received a new gadget from the mail, a giant spider! A few weeks ago I was browsing on eBay and I found this little toy. My twelve years old daughter is scared of spiders so I bought this toy to have some fun :-)

The spider is about 25 centimeter in diameter, powered by 4 AA batteries, Bluetooth 4.0 and remote controlled by my iphone. I hope she still loves me tomorrowâ€¦...
