Maybe you didnâ€™t noticed with all the marketing power of the new versions of RES Software Workspace Manager 2014, Automation Manger 2014 and their IT Store 2014, but last week I also announced a new free community tool, the DeleteUserSettingsWizard.

With this tool end users can delete their individual UserSettings stored by RES Workspace Manager.

Take a look at <link not working> page for more information.

  src_3="DeleteUserSettingsWizard3.png" alt_3="Delete UserSettings wizard" 
  src_4="DeleteUserSettingsWizard4.png" alt_4="Delete UserSettings wizard" 
 >}}

This tool is now used at a customer site and I want to know if you like the tool and if you want any enhancements.  I did already get the request to delete old orphan UserSettings. 

Do you want any more enhancements? Do you have any likes or dislikes?
