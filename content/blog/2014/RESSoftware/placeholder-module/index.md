When creating projects and runbooks in RES Automation Manager, using many modules in a project or runbook can be cluttered or unclear.

{{< image src="simon-kadula-8gr6bObQLOI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Automation Manager Tip" >}}

To make the project or runbook more readable I use a placeholder module. This placeholder module is a module with a disabled task in it. The module name of the placeholder module includes only dashes (-). 

As the module has only a disabled task, the execution time of a project or runbook will hardly be affected. Placing the placeholder module between parts of the project or runbook will make it much more readable.

**Edit**: Now superseeded with the Automation separator option.
