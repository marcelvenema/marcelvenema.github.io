Last week I presented a two day masterclass RES Software Automation Manager 2014 for the company <a href="https://resultaatgroep.nl">ResultaatGroep</a>.

Besides my normal architect and consultant activities I also occasionally train students for the official Citrix, Microsoft and RES Software curriculum. I like teaching classes, besides the variety of normal activities, I also have the opportunity to teach students about real-life experiences during my projects. 

What I especially like about the Automation manager masterclass is that students after a few hours of theory starting to build runbooks for their own cases and get really enthusiastic. At the end of the two day masterclass students can automate for example employee on- and off boarding, create runbooks to solve user profile issues and automate software deployment.
