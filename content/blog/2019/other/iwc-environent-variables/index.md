Besides working in various infrastructure projects, I occasionally teach classes on Citrix, Ivanti or Microsoft technology. In this upcoming series of blogs I like to share some presentations.

{{< image src="aaron-burden-CKlHKtCJZKk-unsplash.jpg" alt="" >}}

This presentation is about using enviroment variables in Ivanti Workspace Control, the former RES Software Workspace Manager product.  Ivanti aquired RES Software back in 2017 and has now two similar workspace products, Ivanti User Workspace Manager (the former AppSense DesktopNow suite) and Ivanti Workspace Control (the former RES Software Workspace Manager). 

Although new features will only be developed in User Workspace Manager, the Workspace Control software is still maintained and available as a long term service release and will be regularly updated. 

presentation no longer available...
