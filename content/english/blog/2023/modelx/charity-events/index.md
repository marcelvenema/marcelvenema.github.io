Today the president of a charity organization phoned me about my application for the Tesla Model X Plaid to drive children at special events.<!--more-->
I was told that the Model X does not fit the organizational profile of Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and other supercars. When my other project, the Porsche 356 Speedster replica, will be finished, I am more than welcome with that car.

Should I have a BMW M3 or Ford Focus RS, there is no problem, since the Tesla Model X is electric, that's kind of an issue. 
I am a little disappointed but, in the end, I must respect this decision. And in a strange way, I totally agree with this decision, it seems it is a bit embarrassing for the drivers of the other cars racing a Tesla Model Xâ€¦..
