Today I received my new gadget: An all-retro gaming console for the Apple Ipad Mini. 

This is so cool! You can download the following games for free Blasteroids (Asteriods), Hop Along (Frogger), Ping (Pong) and Alien Invaders (Space Invaders). My twelve year old daughter loves it and she wants to play it all the time!
