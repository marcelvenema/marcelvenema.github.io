Today the president of a charity organization phoned me about my application for the Tesla Model X Plaid to drive children at special events. I was told that the Model X does not fit the organizational profile of Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and other supercars. When my other project, the Porsche 356 Speedster replica, will be finished, I am more than welcome with that car.
