Ik was er bij met de Tesla Model X Plaid.\nNaast ritten op het circuit was er van alles te doen voor de kinderen en begeleiders: springkussens, gezichten schminken, meerijden met quads, zelf rijden in een lesauto, meerijden om een paar rondjes te driften en ook de innerlijke mens werd goed verzorgd met een uitgebreide barbeque.\nHet meerijden op het circuit is in een treintje van een aantal auto&rsquo;s achter de safety-car. Deze geeft het tempo aan en er mag niet ingehaald worden. Na een aantal ronden keren de auto&rsquo;s terug naar de pits en kunnen kinderen wisselen van auto. De kinderen vonden het fantastisch om een ritje mee te maken. Het grote scherm, de vleugeldeuren, scheetkussen, en natuurlijk de fantastische acceleratie maakte als snel dat de favoriete Porsche, Lamborghini of Ferrari van de kinderen werd ingeruild voor een Tesla Model X :-).\nHet voordeel van de Model X ten opzichte van de andere sportauto&rsquo;s dat deze zes zitplaatsen heeft en er dus vijf kinderen en begeleiders mee kunnen. De ochtend gestart met een volle accu, na iedere rit stonden de kinderen en begeleiders alweer in de rij voor het volgende ritje.\nIn de middag toch even naar de snellader om de accu weer helemaal op te laden. Tijdens de rit er naar toe hoorden we een vreemd getik rechtsvoor bij de ophanging. Eerst dacht ik nog oververhitte remmen, maar het werd alsmaar erger, zodanig, dat verder rijden onverantwoord was.

The Nutanix community is active and supportive, providing a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about hyperconverged infrastructure.\nThere is one downside to Nutanix CE: Due to the hyperconverged architecture, it needs one control virtual machine per physical host, absorbing a minimum of 20GB host memory.\nInstallation To install Nutanix CE (Community Edition), follow these steps:\nVerify hardware compatibility: Nutanix CE has specific hardware requirements, so ensure that your hardware is compatible. You can check the hardware compatibility list on Nutanix&rsquo;s website. Download the Nutanix CE ISO: You can download the Nutanix CE ISO from Nutanix&rsquo;s website. Ensure that you select the correct version for your hardware. You need a free Nutanix account to download Nutanix CE. Create a bootable USB drive: Once you have downloaded the Nutanix CE ISO, create a bootable USB drive using a tool like Rufus or Etcher. Boot the server from the USB drive: Insert the bootable USB drive into the server and boot from it. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the installation process. Configure network settings: During the installation process, you will be prompted to configure the network settings of the AHV hypervisor and Prism Elements CVM. Ensure that you configure the network settings correctly to ensure that Nutanix CE is accessible on your network. Complete the installation: Once you have configured the network settings, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. This may take some time depending on your hardware. Access Nutanix CE: Once the installation is complete, you can access Nutanix CE using the web-based console. You can log in using the default username and password, which is &ldquo;admin&rdquo; and &ldquo;nutanix/4u&rdquo; respectively. When accessing the console on a chromium-based browser via IP address/hostname and not using the full FQDN address, you get a certificate warning. Please type &rsquo;thisisunsafe&rsquo; in the browser window to proceed to the login screen. To resolve this, configure a trusted certificate in the Nutanix Prism configuration and access the console via the FQDN address of the certificate. Note: It&rsquo;s recommended to follow the official Nutanix CE installation guide to ensure that you complete the installation process correctly.\n",

The Model X has only five colors: white, black, grey, blue, and red. I ordered white and wrapped it with the 3M Thundercloud satin color. It has six seats and I choose cream as the interior color. I like Tesla for the Full Self Driving (FSD) features and I cannot wait until this is available in Europe.\nIt will be my daily drive and I want to attend several charity events to drive children at special events. The Tesla Model X Plaid is known for its exceptional performance and acceleration. It can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.6 seconds, providing an exhilarating driving experience. It is faster than most Ferraris, Lamborghinis, or Porsches. Also, the falcon-wing doors are an eyecatcher.\n",

        "content": "The 2048 game is a popular single-player puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid and included in the Nutanix Prism Element or Prism Central web console. It can be reached via the drop-down list menu &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; of the user in the upper right corner of the console. The objective of the game is to slide and merge numbered tiles on the grid to reach the 2048 tile. Here is the strategy for how to win the game.\nIf you do not have the &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; option in the menu, it may be disabled by the administrator. In Settings - Appearance - UI Settings there is a checkbox to disable the game.\nThe basic rules of the game are:\nInitial Setup: The game starts with two randomly generated tiles, each with a value of either 2 or 4, placed on the 4x4 grid.\nTile Movement: You can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide all the tiles on the grid in a particular direction (up, down, left, or right). All tiles move as far as possible in the chosen direction, either until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile.\nTile Merging: If two tiles with the same value collide while moving, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, if two tiles with a value of 2 collide, they merge into a single tile with a value of 4. The merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.\nScoring: Each time you merge two tiles, their values are added to your score. The goal is to continue merging tiles and increasing your score.\nWinning: The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles. However, you can continue playing even after reaching 2048 to achieve higher scores.\nGame Over: The game ends when there are no more available moves. If the entire grid is filled with tiles and no merges can occur, and there are no available moves in any direction, the game is over.\nThe 2048 game is known for its simplicity yet challenging nature, requiring strategic thinking, planning ahead, and making optimal moves to reach higher-numbered tiles and achieve high scores. Luck plays an important role in this game, as the appearance of new tiles is random. However, by applying the strategies below and practicing, you can increase your chances of achieving higher scores and ultimately winning the game of 2048.\nStart with a Corner: Begin the game by focusing on one of the corners, preferably the one that allows the most maneuverability. This approach helps consolidate higher-value tiles in one area and provides more opportunities for merging tiles.\nBuild from Largest to Smallest: Aim to build your largest tiles in one corner and work your way down. Keep the larger tiles in a corner and focus on merging smaller tiles in other areas of the board to clear up space.\nEstablish a Pattern: Try to establish a repeating pattern or sequence of moves that allow you to make efficient and predictable moves. This can help you maintain control over the board and avoid getting trapped.\nKeep the High-Value Tile in a Corner: Once you have a high-value tile (e.g., 512 or 1024), try to keep it in a corner as much as possible. This allows you to make moves without disturbing the high-value tile, increasing the chances of merging it with a similar tile.\nMaintain an Open Path: Keep at least one open path or lane on the board. This ensures that you have room to move tiles around and prevents the board from becoming too congested.\nPlan Ahead: Anticipate your moves and think several steps ahead. Consider how your current move will impact the board and the potential outcomes of subsequent moves. Look for opportunities to create merging possibilities and prevent the board from filling up too quickly.\nPatience and Perseverance: Winning the game requires patience and perseverance. It may take several attempts to achieve a high score or reach the 2048 tile. Learn from each game and refine your strategies accordingly.\nMastering the 2048 game requires a combination of skill, patience, and adaptability. By understanding the game&rsquo;s mechanics and implementing these proven strategies, you can enhance your chances of reaching the coveted 2048 tile and beyond. Remember to start in a corner, build strategically, establish patterns, keep high-value tiles secure, maintain an open path, plan ahead, and be ready to adapt. With practice, persistence, and a willingness to learn from each game, you can unlock the secrets of the 2048 game and experience the thrill of victory. Have fun!\n",

        "content": "As a DevOps engineer, having a clear definition of done is important for several reasons. Also as a DevOps engineer, you want to code and minimize administration. Having participated in multiple projects at multiple companies, I can only give one piece of advice: Have a Definition of Done!\nWhy you should have a Definition of Done (DoD):\nClarity: A definition of done provides clarity on what is expected to be completed for a given task or project. This clarity ensures that all team members are on the same page regarding what constitutes a completed task.\nAccountability: Having a clear DoD ensures that each team member is accountable for their work. By clearly defining what is expected, it&rsquo;s easier to measure progress and ensure that each team member is completing their assigned tasks.\nQuality: A DoD ensures that work is completed to a high standard. By clearly defining the criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that quality is maintained throughout the development process.\nContinuous improvement: A definition of done can also help with continuous improvement. By regularly reviewing the DoD and making adjustments as necessary, it&rsquo;s possible to continually improve the development process and ensure that tasks are completed to the highest possible standard.\nCustomer satisfaction: Finally, having a clear definition of done can help ensure that customer expectations are met. By ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard and meet the criteria set out in the DoD, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that customers are satisfied with the end result.\nHaving a definition of done is crucial for ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard, team members are held accountable for their work, and customer expectations are met. It helps to create a common understanding between all members of the team and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goal.\nHere are some items that should be included in a DoD:\nCode quality: Code should be clean, readable, maintainable, and follow agreed-upon coding standards.\nUnit testing: All code should be tested with automated unit tests that provide high test coverage.\nIntegration testing: The code should be integrated and tested with other components and systems to ensure that it functions correctly in a larger system.\nAcceptance criteria: All acceptance criteria for the user story or task should be met.\nDocumentation: Sufficient documentation should be created for the code, such as code comments, API documentation, user manuals, and technical documentation.\nCode review: The code should be reviewed and approved by other team members, to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.\nPerformance testing: The performance of the code should be tested to ensure that it meets the necessary performance requirements.\nSecurity testing: The code should be tested for security vulnerabilities and ensure that it meets the necessary security standards.\nDeployment: The code should be packaged and deployed to the production environment, following established deployment procedures.\nUser acceptance testing: User acceptance testing should be performed to ensure that the user story or task meets the needs of the end-users.\nNext time, when a manager asks if the user story is ready or done, do not automatically say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but remember the above 10 items :-)\n",

The Model X has only five colors: white, black, grey, blue, and red. I ordered white and wrapped it with the 3M Thundercloud satin color. It has six seats and I choose cream as the interior color. I like Tesla for the Full Self Driving (FSD) features and I cannot wait until this is available in Europe.\nIt will be my daily drive and I want to attend several charity events to drive children at special events. The Tesla Model X Plaid is known for its exceptional performance and acceleration. It can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.6 seconds, providing an exhilarating driving experience. It is faster than most Ferraris, Lamborghinis, or Porsches. Also, the falcon-wing doors are an eyecatcher.\n",

        "content": "The 2048 game is a popular single-player puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid and included in the Nutanix Prism Element or Prism Central web console. It can be reached via the drop-down list menu &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; of the user in the upper right corner of the console. The objective of the game is to slide and merge numbered tiles on the grid to reach the 2048 tile. Here is the strategy for how to win the game.\nIf you do not have the &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; option in the menu, it may be disabled by the administrator. In Settings - Appearance - UI Settings there is a checkbox to disable the game.\nThe basic rules of the game are:\nInitial Setup: The game starts with two randomly generated tiles, each with a value of either 2 or 4, placed on the 4x4 grid.\nTile Movement: You can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide all the tiles on the grid in a particular direction (up, down, left, or right). All tiles move as far as possible in the chosen direction, either until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile.\nTile Merging: If two tiles with the same value collide while moving, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, if two tiles with a value of 2 collide, they merge into a single tile with a value of 4. The merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.\nScoring: Each time you merge two tiles, their values are added to your score. The goal is to continue merging tiles and increasing your score.\nWinning: The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles. However, you can continue playing even after reaching 2048 to achieve higher scores.\nGame Over: The game ends when there are no more available moves. If the entire grid is filled with tiles and no merges can occur, and there are no available moves in any direction, the game is over.\nThe 2048 game is known for its simplicity yet challenging nature, requiring strategic thinking, planning ahead, and making optimal moves to reach higher-numbered tiles and achieve high scores. Luck plays an important role in this game, as the appearance of new tiles is random. However, by applying the strategies below and practicing, you can increase your chances of achieving higher scores and ultimately winning the game of 2048.\nStart with a Corner: Begin the game by focusing on one of the corners, preferably the one that allows the most maneuverability. This approach helps consolidate higher-value tiles in one area and provides more opportunities for merging tiles.\nBuild from Largest to Smallest: Aim to build your largest tiles in one corner and work your way down. Keep the larger tiles in a corner and focus on merging smaller tiles in other areas of the board to clear up space.\nEstablish a Pattern: Try to establish a repeating pattern or sequence of moves that allow you to make efficient and predictable moves. This can help you maintain control over the board and avoid getting trapped.\nKeep the High-Value Tile in a Corner: Once you have a high-value tile (e.g., 512 or 1024), try to keep it in a corner as much as possible. This allows you to make moves without disturbing the high-value tile, increasing the chances of merging it with a similar tile.\nMaintain an Open Path: Keep at least one open path or lane on the board. This ensures that you have room to move tiles around and prevents the board from becoming too congested.\nPlan Ahead: Anticipate your moves and think several steps ahead. Consider how your current move will impact the board and the potential outcomes of subsequent moves. Look for opportunities to create merging possibilities and prevent the board from filling up too quickly.\nPatience and Perseverance: Winning the game requires patience and perseverance. It may take several attempts to achieve a high score or reach the 2048 tile. Learn from each game and refine your strategies accordingly.\nMastering the 2048 game requires a combination of skill, patience, and adaptability. By understanding the game&rsquo;s mechanics and implementing these proven strategies, you can enhance your chances of reaching the coveted 2048 tile and beyond. Remember to start in a corner, build strategically, establish patterns, keep high-value tiles secure, maintain an open path, plan ahead, and be ready to adapt. With practice, persistence, and a willingness to learn from each game, you can unlock the secrets of the 2048 game and experience the thrill of victory. Have fun!\n",

        "content": "As a DevOps engineer, having a clear definition of done is important for several reasons. Also as a DevOps engineer, you want to code and minimize administration. Having participated in multiple projects at multiple companies, I can only give one piece of advice: Have a Definition of Done!\nWhy you should have a Definition of Done (DoD):\nClarity: A definition of done provides clarity on what is expected to be completed for a given task or project. This clarity ensures that all team members are on the same page regarding what constitutes a completed task.\nAccountability: Having a clear DoD ensures that each team member is accountable for their work. By clearly defining what is expected, it&rsquo;s easier to measure progress and ensure that each team member is completing their assigned tasks.\nQuality: A DoD ensures that work is completed to a high standard. By clearly defining the criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that quality is maintained throughout the development process.\nContinuous improvement: A definition of done can also help with continuous improvement. By regularly reviewing the DoD and making adjustments as necessary, it&rsquo;s possible to continually improve the development process and ensure that tasks are completed to the highest possible standard.\nCustomer satisfaction: Finally, having a clear definition of done can help ensure that customer expectations are met. By ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard and meet the criteria set out in the DoD, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that customers are satisfied with the end result.\nHaving a definition of done is crucial for ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard, team members are held accountable for their work, and customer expectations are met. It helps to create a common understanding between all members of the team and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goal.\nHere are some items that should be included in a DoD:\nCode quality: Code should be clean, readable, maintainable, and follow agreed-upon coding standards.\nUnit testing: All code should be tested with automated unit tests that provide high test coverage.\nIntegration testing: The code should be integrated and tested with other components and systems to ensure that it functions correctly in a larger system.\nAcceptance criteria: All acceptance criteria for the user story or task should be met.\nDocumentation: Sufficient documentation should be created for the code, such as code comments, API documentation, user manuals, and technical documentation.\nCode review: The code should be reviewed and approved by other team members, to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.\nPerformance testing: The performance of the code should be tested to ensure that it meets the necessary performance requirements.\nSecurity testing: The code should be tested for security vulnerabilities and ensure that it meets the necessary security standards.\nDeployment: The code should be packaged and deployed to the production environment, following established deployment procedures.\nUser acceptance testing: User acceptance testing should be performed to ensure that the user story or task meets the needs of the end-users.\nNext time, when a manager asks if the user story is ready or done, do not automatically say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but remember the above 10 items :-)\n",

        "content": "(Dutch content) Zaterdag 8 juli was de droomautodag (https://droomautodag.nl) georganiseerd door DFCharity, waarbij kinderen tussen 6 en 16 jaar oud met een vervelende ziekte een dag autoritten met droomauto&rsquo;s konden maken op het circuit in Meppen (D), vlak over de grens bij Emmen. Ik was er bij met de Tesla Model X Plaid.\nNaast ritten op het circuit was er van alles te doen voor de kinderen en begeleiders: springkussens, gezichten schminken, meerijden met quads, zelf rijden in een lesauto, meerijden om een paar rondjes te driften en ook de innerlijke mens werd goed verzorgd met een uitgebreide barbeque.\nHet meerijden op het circuit is in een treintje van een aantal auto&rsquo;s achter de safety-car. Deze geeft het tempo aan en er mag niet ingehaald worden. Na een aantal ronden keren de auto&rsquo;s terug naar de pits en kunnen kinderen wisselen van auto. De kinderen vonden het fantastisch om een ritje mee te maken. Het grote scherm, de vleugeldeuren, scheetkussen, en natuurlijk de fantastische acceleratie maakte als snel dat de favoriete Porsche, Lamborghini of Ferrari van de kinderen werd ingeruild voor een Tesla Model X :-).\nHet voordeel van de Model X ten opzichte van de andere sportauto&rsquo;s dat deze zes zitplaatsen heeft en er dus vijf kinderen en begeleiders mee kunnen. De ochtend gestart met een volle accu, na iedere rit stonden de kinderen en begeleiders alweer in de rij voor het volgende ritje.\nIn de middag toch even naar de snellader om de accu weer helemaal op te laden. Tijdens de rit er naar toe hoorden we een vreemd getik rechtsvoor bij de ophanging. Eerst dacht ik nog oververhitte remmen, maar het werd alsmaar erger, zodanig, dat verder rijden onverantwoord was. Tesla Service gebeld, en na het remote uitlezen van de auto, full reset en wat aanpassingen aan de configuratie bleek de auto toch op transport te moeten naar het Service Center in Zwolle/Wezep. Minpunt was dat wij zelf vervangend vervoer naar huis hebben moeten regelen.\nDe mensen van het Tesla service center waren super vriendelijk. Het probleem bleek achteraf losgetrilde wielmoeren te zijn waardoor er een halve centimeter speling tussen de velg en naaf zat.\nVermoedelijk zijn de wielen niet met het juiste aanhaalmoment vastgedraaid bij aflevering in Tilburg of vanuit de fabriek in Fremont.\nOndanks pech was het een erg leuke dag gehad en het was onbeschrijvelijk hoeveel de kinderen plezier hebben gehad in de ritten met de Tesla. We zijn er zeker weer bij tijdens de volgende editie van de droomautodag op zaterdag 11 november.\n",

Access Nutanix CE: Once the installation is complete, you can access Nutanix CE using the web-based console. You can log in using the default username and password, which is &ldquo;admin&rdquo; and &ldquo;nutanix/4u&rdquo; respectively. When accessing the console on a chromium-based browser via IP address/hostname and not using the full FQDN address, you get a certificate warning. Please type &rsquo;thisisunsafe&rsquo; in the browser window to proceed to the login screen. To resolve this, configure a trusted certificate in the Nutanix Prism configuration and access the console via the FQDN address of the certificate. Note: It&rsquo;s recommended to follow the official Nutanix CE installation guide to ensure that you complete the installation process correctly.\n",

After waiting more than two years, I got an SMS from Tesla the car would be delivered to the Tesla Delivery Center in Tilburg, The Netherlands.\nThe car was on my bucket list for several years and I am extremely happy that checkbox can be ticked. The Model X has only five colors: white, black, grey, blue, and red. I ordered white and wrapped it with the 3M Thundercloud satin color. It has six seats and I choose cream as the interior color. I like Tesla for the Full Self Driving (FSD) features and I cannot wait until this is available in Europe.\nIt will be my daily drive and I want to attend several charity events to drive children at special events. The Tesla Model X Plaid is known for its exceptional performance and acceleration. It can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.6 seconds, providing an exhilarating driving experience. It is faster than most Ferraris, Lamborghinis, or Porsches. Also, the falcon-wing doors are an eyecatcher.\n",

        "content": "The 2048 game is a popular single-player puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid and included in the Nutanix Prism Element or Prism Central web console. It can be reached via the drop-down list menu &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; of the user in the upper right corner of the console. The objective of the game is to slide and merge numbered tiles on the grid to reach the 2048 tile. Here is the strategy for how to win the game.\nIf you do not have the &lsquo;Nothing To Do?&rsquo; option in the menu, it may be disabled by the administrator. In Settings - Appearance - UI Settings there is a checkbox to disable the game.\nThe basic rules of the game are:\nInitial Setup: The game starts with two randomly generated tiles, each with a value of either 2 or 4, placed on the 4x4 grid.\nTile Movement: You can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide all the tiles on the grid in a particular direction (up, down, left, or right). All tiles move as far as possible in the chosen direction, either until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile.\nTile Merging: If two tiles with the same value collide while moving, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, if two tiles with a value of 2 collide, they merge into a single tile with a value of 4. The merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.\nScoring: Each time you merge two tiles, their values are added to your score. The goal is to continue merging tiles and increasing your score.\nWinning: The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles. However, you can continue playing even after reaching 2048 to achieve higher scores.\nGame Over: The game ends when there are no more available moves. If the entire grid is filled with tiles and no merges can occur, and there are no available moves in any direction, the game is over.\nThe 2048 game is known for its simplicity yet challenging nature, requiring strategic thinking, planning ahead, and making optimal moves to reach higher-numbered tiles and achieve high scores. Luck plays an important role in this game, as the appearance of new tiles is random. However, by applying the strategies below and practicing, you can increase your chances of achieving higher scores and ultimately winning the game of 2048.\nStart with a Corner: Begin the game by focusing on one of the corners, preferably the one that allows the most maneuverability. This approach helps consolidate higher-value tiles in one area and provides more opportunities for merging tiles.\nBuild from Largest to Smallest: Aim to build your largest tiles in one corner and work your way down. Keep the larger tiles in a corner and focus on merging smaller tiles in other areas of the board to clear up space.\nEstablish a Pattern: Try to establish a repeating pattern or sequence of moves that allow you to make efficient and predictable moves. This can help you maintain control over the board and avoid getting trapped.\nKeep the High-Value Tile in a Corner: Once you have a high-value tile (e.g., 512 or 1024), try to keep it in a corner as much as possible. This allows you to make moves without disturbing the high-value tile, increasing the chances of merging it with a similar tile.\nMaintain an Open Path: Keep at least one open path or lane on the board. This ensures that you have room to move tiles around and prevents the board from becoming too congested.\nPlan Ahead: Anticipate your moves and think several steps ahead. Consider how your current move will impact the board and the potential outcomes of subsequent moves. Look for opportunities to create merging possibilities and prevent the board from filling up too quickly.\nPatience and Perseverance: Winning the game requires patience and perseverance. It may take several attempts to achieve a high score or reach the 2048 tile. Learn from each game and refine your strategies accordingly.\nMastering the 2048 game requires a combination of skill, patience, and adaptability. By understanding the game&rsquo;s mechanics and implementing these proven strategies, you can enhance your chances of reaching the coveted 2048 tile and beyond. Remember to start in a corner, build strategically, establish patterns, keep high-value tiles secure, maintain an open path, plan ahead, and be ready to adapt. With practice, persistence, and a willingness to learn from each game, you can unlock the secrets of the 2048 game and experience the thrill of victory. Have fun!\n",

        "content": "As a DevOps engineer, having a clear definition of done is important for several reasons. Also as a DevOps engineer, you want to code and minimize administration. Having participated in multiple projects at multiple companies, I can only give one piece of advice: Have a Definition of Done!\nWhy you should have a Definition of Done (DoD):\nClarity: A definition of done provides clarity on what is expected to be completed for a given task or project. This clarity ensures that all team members are on the same page regarding what constitutes a completed task.\nAccountability: Having a clear DoD ensures that each team member is accountable for their work. By clearly defining what is expected, it&rsquo;s easier to measure progress and ensure that each team member is completing their assigned tasks.\nQuality: A DoD ensures that work is completed to a high standard. By clearly defining the criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that quality is maintained throughout the development process.\nContinuous improvement: A definition of done can also help with continuous improvement. By regularly reviewing the DoD and making adjustments as necessary, it&rsquo;s possible to continually improve the development process and ensure that tasks are completed to the highest possible standard.\nCustomer satisfaction: Finally, having a clear definition of done can help ensure that customer expectations are met. By ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard and meet the criteria set out in the DoD, it&rsquo;s easier to ensure that customers are satisfied with the end result.\nHaving a definition of done is crucial for ensuring that tasks are completed to a high standard, team members are held accountable for their work, and customer expectations are met. It helps to create a common understanding between all members of the team and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goal.\nHere are some items that should be included in a DoD:\nCode quality: Code should be clean, readable, maintainable, and follow agreed-upon coding standards.\nUnit testing: All code should be tested with automated unit tests that provide high test coverage.\nIntegration testing: The code should be integrated and tested with other components and systems to ensure that it functions correctly in a larger system.\nAcceptance criteria: All acceptance criteria for the user story or task should be met.\nDocumentation: Sufficient documentation should be created for the code, such as code comments, API documentation, user manuals, and technical documentation.\nCode review: The code should be reviewed and approved by other team members, to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.\nPerformance testing: The performance of the code should be tested to ensure that it meets the necessary performance requirements.\nSecurity testing: The code should be tested for security vulnerabilities and ensure that it meets the necessary security standards.\nDeployment: The code should be packaged and deployed to the production environment, following established deployment procedures.\nUser acceptance testing: User acceptance testing should be performed to ensure that the user story or task meets the needs of the end-users.\nNext time, when a manager asks if the user story is ready or done, do not automatically say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but remember the above 10 items :-)\n",
